# Online Library and Bookstore
# Executive summary of project
 A platform for the public where they can borrow and buy books from the same portal. The reader can borrow as well as can buy a book from the Bookstore/ Library. There are many online platforms of library Management System and BookStore. But there is no such platform where both Library Management System and Bookstore are working in the same portal. Both systems are working on separate platforms. We aspire to build a  project where Public can buy and borrow the books from the same portal. This project will mainly have 2 features. One feature is that the reader can borrow the book from the library and then afterwards he will have to return it within due date. In case the borrower returns the book after the due date, he will have to pay the fine. Second one is that the reader or the customer can buy a book from the store. Buying a book will not result in shortage of books as there will always be in stock. In case of borrowing/buying the book from the library/bookstore, some specific record of the borrower/reader will be kept by the lender on which he can contact if needed. Using this platform, the user can get any book he wants. This will save his time to search for the book on the internet or going to the store or library to find the book. Moreover if a person can not afford buying a book, he can borrow that book rather than purchasing it. 
 The customer or reader can view the available books. They can borrow or buy the book. The admin or lender will have control on the book records. He will maintain the book records. He can add new books or remove useless books from the portal according to the need. The admin will also maintain a record of readers who borrowed/purchased the book. And when the book will be returned, he can remove his record from the list.
We will be creating a desktop application using C# and .NET Frameworks.
